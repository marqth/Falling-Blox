# Falling-Blox
Falling Blox Project- y2022/2023  

For this project, we had to create our own version of the famous game Tetris.
  
In order to realise this project, we had to follow a multitude of instructions, helping us building the game step by step, while making us discover coding tips and good practices, such as code refactorisation.  
  
With this program, you will be able to play a full game of Tetris, just like the original.  
Note : You can add up to 2 arguments in the main, to add elements before the game starts, and you can also disable the music by commenting the lines with the function "ajouterMesique()" in the "FallingBloxVersion1" file.  
  
You will also find in this repository a pdf document explaining all of the game's controls.  
  
To use this program :  
  
Be sure you have an IDE that can run java projects in the first place (We used Eclipse for the project)  
Then, download the folder Falling_Blox_EN if you want the English version of the program, or Falling_Blox_FR if you want the French one  
Finally, in both cases, after unzipping the folder you just downloaded, open it as a project in your IDE, open the folder "Falling Blox" that just appeared, then go in "src", then, in the "fr.eseo.e3.poo.projet.blox" package, and run the "FallingBloxVersion1" file !
